Welcome to the Quizzed-on-anything repository. 

This website works in the following manner.
  - Users pass in a subject in the text box available.
  - The website then generates a series of 6 questions (using open AI's 3.5 turbo API) related to that topic which the user can answer.
  - The user answers the multiple choice questions and their score is displayed at the end.

This project is written using the python Flask framwork and deployed using Heroku.
